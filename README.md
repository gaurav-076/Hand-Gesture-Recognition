# Hand-Gesture-Recognition
Numerous technological developments and much study have been made to benefit the deaf and dumb. Deep learning and computer vision are two tools that can be used to further the cause.

This can be extended to constructing automatic editors, where a person can easily write by using just their hand gestures, which can be very helpful for the deaf and dumb in interacting with others as knowing hand gestures is not something that is common to all.

#Pre-requisites

Python,
Numpy,
cv2 (openCV),
Keras,
Tensorflow.

Project is divided into three parts:  

1.Creation of dataset  
2.Training of CNN model  
3.Prediction  
Run code one after another
   
   In Creation of dataset: Create two folder for train and test
